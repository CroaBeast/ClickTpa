# ClickTpa

I started this project around September of 2018, and since then, have worked on it on and off. 
Throughout the years, I've taken multiple lengthy breaks, away from coding, to play other games with friends.
Over these past 2 1/2 years, I would like to say that I feel more confident with my coding skills and knowledge.
I'm self-taught, and looking at my code now, I don't really feel proud in it as it just seems like a mess.
Today, I'm taking classes that focus on coding, and now that I understand more about java, I am able to create better programs.
I plan on rewriting all of ClickTpa (to release ClickTpa 2), and to become more active overall. 
I'm thankful for what I have achieved and will only go further to better improve. 

Thank you to everyone who has downloaded my plugin!
