# Becareful in this part!
# This is when a player uses not enough args
# For example, when a player does '/tpa', it will say 'Usage: /tpa <player>'
# So please fit the correct command under the correct message!
# P.S '/tpohere' is also '/s' (essentials-type command).

# This section is when a player gets a tpa request
# Since the code used is broken into many parts, there will be many messages.
# Be careful!

# Helpful tip: to do a new line please use '\n'.
# Use '%player%' for the player who sent the request.
# Use '%accept%' for the 'Click-to-accept' message.
# Use '%deny%' for the 'Click-to-deny' message.
# Use '%target%' for the player who they wanted to teleport to, and for the 'Player-sent-request' message. 
# Example: /tpa <player>, where <player> is '%target%'.
